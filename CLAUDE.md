# Whiskey Tasting Book — project context

Read `SPEC.md` before changing anything. It is the build spec and it is current.
`SETUP.md` covers the one-time Microsoft/iPhone setup, which is already done.

## Non-negotiable

1. **Never call `.save()` on `Whiskey Collection.xlsx`.** It is 147 MB and holds 198 bottle photos
   as Excel rich values. openpyxl cannot round-trip them; a single save destroys all of them.
   Read it with `load_workbook(path, read_only=True, data_only=True)` and nothing else. New rows go
   in by the zip-level surgical append in SPEC.md §8, which fills a row that already exists inside
   the table and verifies every media part afterwards.
2. **Journal files are immutable.** Corrections are new revision files, deletions are tombstones.
   `write_tasting` refuses to overwrite an existing revision — leave that guard in place.
3. **Every generated filename needs sub-second uniqueness.** See SPEC.md §0. This bug appeared
   three times; it is always silent.
4. **The phone never reaches the collection workbook.** Its OAuth scope is
   `Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder` only. New bottles queue in `pending/` and a human approves them on
   the PC.
5. The career score is the mean of counted sittings; the medal comes from that mean rounded
   **half-up** (`rubric.half_up`, not `round()`). Do not print a total under the per-category means
   — ten roundings drift and it would contradict the headline (SPEC.md §3.6).

## Working style

Save each step as it is finished, and run its tests before starting the next. Every module here has
a matching `test_*.py` that runs standalone.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -p "test_*.py"     # 65 tests, all passing
python collection.py                           # health report, writes nothing
```

`test_collection.py` SHA-256s the master workbook before and after loading. If that test ever
fails, stop everything.

## State as of 8 Sep 2026

Done and tested — `collection.py` (loader), `rubric.py` (scoring), `store.py` (journal),
`rollup.py` (generates `Whiskey Tastings.xlsx`).

Web front end — **in progress.** `app.py` (Flask server at `127.0.0.1:8765`), the judging sheet
and the flight/session view (`static/index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`) are done and tested —
SPEC.md build order steps 3 and 4. Covered by `test_app.py` (100 tests total). Sessions are a
first-class journal record: `store.write_session/sessions/session/next_flight_pos`, immutable with
revisions like tastings, filed under `sessions/` with an **`F-`** prefix (not `S-`, which is
already a Sample code). `rollup.py` grew a `Sessions` sheet. A standalone pour and a flight are the
same thing in the UI — a list of pours with one active — so the sheet renders a pour, not a global
scorecard. The server reads the spirit list from
`snapshot/collection.json` on every request and opens the master only on an explicit
`POST /api/refresh` (read-only, via `collection.load`); it has no path that writes the master.
The rubric now carries per-category `question` text (config.yaml) for the `?` tooltips, and the
overall note is stored under `notes["overall"]` so `store.py` keeps its single notes dict. Flask
is the chosen framework (SPEC.md §6 sanctioned FastAPI or Flask); added to requirements.txt.

Still to build — table view (sort/filter + `$ per oz`), compare, Quick Entry drain, analysis charts
(SPEC.md §7 steps 5–8), then the iPhone static client and the §8 pending bottle approval UI.
Known gap: unsubmitted pours live only in the browser, so reloading mid-flight loses the drafts —
the flight and every submitted pour are safe on the server. A local draft cache is the fix. It serves two clients from one codebase: the PC app at `127.0.0.1:8765`, and a
static build in `docs/` deployed to GitHub Pages for the iPhone. Design is settled: see SPEC.md §5
(tokens), §9.2 (iOS rules), §10 (the approved mockups — three PC screens, six phone screens). Build
the phone client to iOS conventions; 44 pt touch targets, safe-area insets, 16 px inputs, its own
back navigation, offline-first with a local queue.
